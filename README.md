# TypingAssignment

Objective:
The key things we are looking for in your submission are:
1) The approach you take towards building your application. The overall thought process
& whether you’ve taken multiple customer use-cases into consideration.
2) Attention to detail
3) Github link to source code in a deployable state. The link to a demo site is even better.
Description:
You are required to build a web-based application for touch typing. Touch typing is typing
without looking at the keyboard. The fundamental idea is that each finger is given its own
section of the keyboard and your fingers learn the location of the keyboard through practising
regularly and gaining muscle memory to eventually build up speed whilst typing.
While touch typing is a practice of keys, words & sentences. For this exercise, we’ll focus only
on keys practice & only on the 8 keys of the keyboard (asdfjkl;)

Based on the information provided. Design and develop a web-based application in ReactJs.
Must haves:
1) A typing box wherein the user is typing keys
2) Visually the user should be able to see the keys they’re supposed to type next
3) Measuring the number of keys pressed in a 5 min window of practice
4) Measuring the accuracy %

Nice to have features:
1) Use appropriate images if possible.
2) Use CSS3 for design and layout
3) Use any state management tool for React. For ex Redux
4) Use middleware libraries such as Redux Saga for external resource access asynchronously
